# Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree - Projekt 1 - Predicting Boston Housing Prices

## Project Overview
This is the first project of the [Machine Learning Nanodegree Program from Udacity](https://eu.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009). In this project, I applied basic machine learning concepts on a dataset of housing prices in Boston, Massachusetts. In the project, I build a decision tree regressor and used various machine learning techniques to evaluate the quality of the decision tree model. The goal of the project was to get acquainted with the following concepts of machine learning:

* Training and testing data
* Goodness of fit: Coefficient of determination (R^2)
* Over- and underfitting
* Bias-variance tradeoff
* Grid search
* Cross-validation

## Learning goals of the project

- How to use NumPy to investigate the latent features of a dataset.
- How to analyze various learning performance plots for variance and bias.
- How to determine the best-guess model for predictions from unseen data.
- How to evaluate a model's performance on unseen data using previous data.

## Softwares and libraries
